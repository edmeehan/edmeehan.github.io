Thanks for checking out my little corner of the web. I'm a front-end developer in San Diego. I love to surf, and I enjoy building things both physical and digital. I have always been creative, and a little different than everyone else. For starters, I'm taller than you. I don't even need to tell you how tall, just know that I am. I have the strange ability to recognize voices, but can't remember names. I am a bit of an analytical thinker, so am always fighting my gut instinct. I dislike the term &ldquo;business as usual&rdquo; but use it all the time.

This site serves as my only online fingerprint since you won't find me on Facebook or Twitter anymore. In an effort to control the crap streaming to my devices I cut them off, and must resort to old-fashioned communication... texting. No, but seriously, when was the last time you just called someone. I remember rotary phones, I wonder if senior citizens think the same way about the telegraph.

Well if you're still here then congratulations, you passed the &ldquo;what the crap was he talking about&rdquo; test. I reward you no points, and may god have mercy on your soul. Enjoy the rest of the <s>site</s> page.
