I met John Steiner, the founder of MX Trackbuilders, in 2010. John is a motocross track designer and builder. He can look at a plot of land and visualize turns and jumps, and then mold the soil into his vision. John had a website for his business, but his content was old, and he had no quick way to update it. In 2013 John approached me to build him a new website for his motocross track company.

## 2013 Website Build
John's old website was static and was a mix of <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and Flash. These types of sites were common back in the day of [Macromedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macromedia) Dreamweaver and Flash (now owned by Adobe). I even built a few myself back in the early 2000s. Flash sites looked cool, but they were a nightmare to update. Flash compiled <abbr title="Shockwave Flash">SWF</abbr> export files, and if you didn't have the source <abbr title="Flash">FLA</abbr> file, then good luck! Also, a static site back then involved using tools like <abbr title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</abbr> to push data back and forth to the server. The website was old school, and he hired me to bring him into the new school (of 2013).

In 2013 I was building websites with [PyroCMS](https://pyrocms.com/). It is a content management system (built on CodeIgnitor at that time) or <abbr title="Content Managment System">CMS</abbr> as we call it in the industry. A CMS is excellent for creating content online (like a  blog post, for instance), and then display that content based on a route (<abbr title="Universal Resource Locator">URL</abbr> path). CMS systems also have an admin area, which allows you to create new content (no FTP required), think Wordpress (then quickly forget it). I built John's new website on PyroCMS so that he could add new content quickly. I added a photo gallery and blog to his site. Since many of John's customers found him through his website, I also developed a sales lead capture form. And finally, to give the website a competitive edge, I hired a designer and friend, [Micah Alexander](http://micahalexander.com/), to design the logo and site layout.

We launched the site, and John's <abbr title="Search Engine Optimization">SEO</abbr> ranking grew and quickly blew away his competition. He was top listing in all the target keywords across Google. As any wise SEO person will tell you *"Content is King!"* and now that John's website was on a CMS, he could update it often. John was impressed with all the new features.

## 2019 Website Build
So fast-forward six years since I launched John's MX Trackbuilders website. John's business competitors were starting to catch up with the website. The internet had changed since then, and so had the options for making websites. Options like [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/), Weebly, and Wix have improved and now offer excellent features for websites. Unlike a CMS, which required you to host and manage yourself, these services operate as a platform or <abbr title="Software as a Service">SaaS</abbr>. The service provider does all the hosting and management, while also providing things like security and feature improvements, and you as a customer pay a monthly or annual fee. Simple right?! It's the reason I no longer build or manage CMS systems.

John approached me during one of our many surf sessions about building him a new website. I had wanted to try theme development on Squarespace, and the platform had all the features he needed. Squarespace also has a mobile app so John could update his website while traveling. Squarespace was a natural choice, so I quickly got started reading the documentation and downloading the developer tools.

### New Design by Konig Media
To kick things off, I put John in contact with a design mentor and friend Joe Konig of [Konig Media](https://konigmedia.com/). Joe is a seasoned web designer and has experience in action sports. I spoke with Joe about developing the website on Squarespace, and he agreed it was the right choice. Joe pitched John on a new and clean site design with a focus around his media content.

### Squarespace Theme Development
Squarespace development is limited to the theme (website look and feel). They use modern tools to allow for theme customization, but to be honest, I found development to be awkward. For instance, the Squarespace platform manages the layout of each page, meaning I would need to login to the platform admin to build a page layout with the <abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr> tools. As a developer, I hate this workflow, but I get why they did it. It opens up a bunch of options for building new pages since now you can create the page layout yourself instead of selecting from a prebuilt template page.

Since Squarespace is a platform, customization options are limited to what they allow. For instance, the customized lead capture form I had built before would require the purchase of additional services. SaaS platforms often upsell features.

### Squarespace Site Launch

I recently launched John's new website, and he is thrilled with the design and Squarespace features.
> The new site is polished, bright, imagery forward, and professional looking. The new system is convenient. It has all the tools I need to get my images loaded quick and easy. It will save me time, and allow me to keep the website current and up to date with our latest projects.

## Conclusion
Squarespace is an excellent option for small to medium-sized businesses. Quickly add custom pages with a layout to fit your needs. I think this platform pairs well with designers since the tools focus on a GUI for page layout and content. I might explore custom theme development in the future if a client should ask for it. I found theme development to be a little awkward, but I was impressed with the modern tools and customization features.
