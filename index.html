        <h2>Available for Freelance</h2>
        <p>I am looking to take on new projects and clients, remote or Southern California.</p>

    <p>I have always enjoyed building things, as a child, I would spend hours building a model car or airplane. As my skills improved I started tackling larger and more complex models. Fast-forward to adulthood and I now build with keystrokes and mouse-clicks. Over the years I have worked with well-known brands like Intuit, Callaway Golf, Patagonia, Keurig, and Adidas.</p>
