                <p>I have always enjoyed building things and have been lucky enough to have found a career that alows me to do just that and also get paid. In order to build something of value, you need to ask questions and understand what you're building, who is going to use it, and why they will use it.</p>
                <h3 class="">Can A/B testing help?</h3>
                <p>A question has brought you here, most likely through a Google search. The question of how you can improve your online sales or conversion funnel with A/B testing. Or maybe you already tried A/B testing and you’re ready to make it a regular part of your marketing workflow. Either way, your questions have brought you to the right place.</p>
                <h3 class="">Agency tested, results proven!</h3>
                <p>I am a web developer who has worked in online marketing since 2005. Over the years I have had the chance to work on just about every aspect of online marketing from microsites, to banner ads. A/B testing started to become popular around 2014 due to new tools like Optimizely and Monetate giving small companies access to tools larger online tech companies had been using for years.</p>
                <p>If your company is ready to start A/B testing or looking to improve your current testing and measuring process then I can help. Send me a message on my contact form and let's have a conversation.</p>
