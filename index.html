                        <img class="logo" width="100" height="100" src="/img/logos/callaway.png" alt="Callaway Golf logo">
                        <h3 class="weight-normal">Callaway Golf</h3>
                        <p>Designed and developed weekly emails, landing pages, and various merchandising banners. Also my first big refactor project that reduced average page size by 75%. I was a team leader and developed workflows to reduce production time on projects.</p>
                        
                        <img class="logo" width="100" height="100" src="/img/logos/intuit.png" alt="Intuit logo">
                        <h3 class="weight-normal">Intuit</h3>
                        <p>Hired as a seasonal contractor I built new home pages and landing pages for <a href="https://turbotax.intuit.com/">turbotax.intuit.com</a> and <a href="https://www.quicken.com/">quicken.com</a> marketing sites. Worked on a redesign of the TurboTax blog and got a chance to hack some Java. Also added a consumer rating feature on quicken.com using a service API.</p>
                        
                        <img class="logo" width="100" height="100" src="/img/logos/homedepot.png" alt="Home Depot logo">
                        <h3 class="weight-normal">Home Depot</h3>
                        <p>An agency managed the <a href="https://careers.homedepot.com/">careers.homedepot.com</a> website and hired me as a freelance front-end and PHP developer. I built new landing pages, improved the job search feature and developed an API. I impressed the team when I integrated a deployment tool into the production workflow that allowed for quick deploys and rollbacks.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="weight-normal">Clearhead</h3>
                        <p>A former executive at Callaway Golf joined an optimization agency and brought me on as a freelance developer. I had the opportunity to work on some of their larger accounts like <strong>Patagonia, Keurig, Adidas, Art Institutes, Daily Burn, Warner Music, Fresh Direct, and Callaway Golf.</strong></p>

                        <h2 class="h1 font-cursive">Activities</h2>
                        <hr>
                        <p>My idea of fun involves a day at the beach or camping with friends. Our dog Tink loves to play at the OB dog park, and it's a good excuse to get away from my computer.</p>

                        <h3 class="font-cursive">Surfing</h3>
                        <p>I have been surfing since I was a teenager. Some of my best memories of Hawaii are driving around with my friends checking different surf spots. Always hopeful the best wave was just around the corner. Most times we would get skunked, but every so often we would hit gold and score some of the best waves ever. Every surfer remembers their best wave. It's a feeling like no other.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="font-cursive">10th Planet Jiu&ndash;Jitsu</h3>
                        <p>I started my journey down the jiu-jitsu road in March of 2016. I was looking for fun ways to lose weight, and I didn't expect to find a new passion. It's put me on a path to be in the best shape of mylife. I'm pretty excited to see what it has in store for my future.</p>
